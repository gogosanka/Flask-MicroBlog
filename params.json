{"name":"Python Micro Blog","tagline":"A web application boilerplate built off of Flask, Bootstrap, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Love.","body":"### Welcome to the Python Micro Blog Project.\r\nOriginally this was based off of the Flask Mega Tutorial and the Flask Web Development book written by Miguel Grinberg. There are some bugs in this version, however I decided to freeze development of this project and continue developing in a different direction. For the sake of learning and boilerplate information, please feel free to use this as you wish. More information can be found and learned by visiting the Flask documentation, and searching for the Flask Mega Tutorial online.\r\n\r\nFor questions, comments, issues with this boilerplate- well, you know where to find me! I will be more than happy to address them (as they are most likely nonexistent in my local version of the files at this time).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
